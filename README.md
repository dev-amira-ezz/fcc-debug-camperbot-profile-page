# Debug Camperbot's Profile Page - Lab from freeCodeCamp

This is a lab project built as part of the [Full-Stack Web Development certification program](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org).  

## 🧾 Project Objective

Camperbot is trying to build a profile page. They asked a friend to look over their code and they said it has some errors.  

Your job is to fix all of Camperbot's errors so they can continue building their profile page. Complete the items in the user stories below and click "Run the Tests" to see if you fixed all the errors.  

## 📋 User Stories 


1. Camperbot is trying to use a `heading2` element, but that element does not exist. Fix those tags so it uses a correct second-level heading element.  
2. Camperbot is trying to add two paragraphs with `pp`, but those don't exist either. Fix them so they use correct paragraph tags.  
3. Camperbot is using an `h3` element for the `Background and Interests` subheading but it has a syntax error. Spot the issue and resolve it.
